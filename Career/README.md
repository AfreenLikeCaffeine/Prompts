# AI Career Coach Prompts

This repository contains the exact prompts I’ve been using to level up my career — prompts that helped me move from **Senior Engineer to Senior+ mindset** by acting as a daily accountability partner, pressure tester, and reflective coach.

These aren’t role-specific scripts. Instead, they are **structured workflows** designed to:
- Keep focus on **promo-doc worthy outcomes**  
- Pressure-test decisions against **Senior+ expectations**  
- Identify and eliminate friction instead of tolerating it  
- Push past hesitation, comfort-zone work, and weak feedback loops  
- Drive visibility, business impact, and scalable leverage

## Included Prompts

### 1. **Daily Senior+ Check-In**
- Forces daily clarity on:
  - The **highest-impact task** worth promo-doc space
  - Friction/confusion to eliminate instead of adapt to
  - One uncomfortable or risky move to lean into for growth
- Ends with **Blind Spot Checks** and a **Senior+ Push** from the AI coach

### 2. **Weekly Reflection & Planning**
- Sharp audit of the past week:
  - Which wins were actually promo-doc worthy
  - Where I stalled, avoided, or rationalized
  - What I’ll adjust next week to break patterns
- Defines **1–2 aggressive, leveraged goals** for the upcoming week
- Includes a **Promo-Lens Filter** to ensure only high-bar outcomes stand

### 3. **Growth Levers Framework**
- Four pillars I revisit weekly to stay Senior+ aligned:
  1. **Lead Design** – clarify trade-offs, set direction, own outcomes  
  2. **Scale Impact** – docs, automation, frameworks, templates  
  3. **Follow Through on Shipping** – metrics, adoption, stakeholder engagement  
  4. **Share Wins** – tie accomplishments to business/customer outcomes and make them visible

## How to Use

1. Copy the prompts into your workflow (Copilot, journal, Notion, Obsidian, or even ChatGPT/Claude).  
2. Run the **Daily Check-In** each morning — answer honestly, then let the AI push back.  
3. On **Fridays**, do the **Weekly Reflection** to summarize wins and set next week’s focus.  
4. Revisit the **Growth Levers** weekly as a lens to avoid drifting back into “solid Senior” comfort work.

## Why This Works

These prompts don’t require job-specific context. They work because they push you to **operate differently**:
- From execution → to leverage  
- From shipping code → to driving adoption and business impact  
- From avoiding discomfort → to leaning into visibility and influence  

In short: they make sure you’re not just “doing the job” — you’re **operating at the next level.**
