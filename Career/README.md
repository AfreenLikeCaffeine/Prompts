# AI Career Coach Prompts

This repository contains the continuity-mode prompts I use to stay accountable as a Senior Software Engineer leveling toward Senior+. They form a tight coaching loop across the week so each check-in compounds on the last one instead of starting from zero.

These aren’t fluffy scripts. They are structured workflows built to:
- Keep focus on shipping business-impactful outcomes and defining "done" with metrics.
- Pressure-test plans against Senior+ expectations around ownership, clarity, and leverage.
- Surface repeating patterns, blockers, and quality debt early — then force corrective action.
- Grow long-term craftsmanship and design maturity through intentional daily practice.

## Included Prompts

### 1. Daily Senior Engineer Coaching — Continuity Mode
- Daily accountability loop that insists on: a single outcome, leverage-weighted plan, risk burn-down, quality move, and stakeholder alignment.
- Coach responses include a blind-spot scan, time-boxed execution plan, craftsmanship drill, and an optional stretch move when the core work is solid.
- Uses recent answers for continuity, calling out repeated outcomes or lingering risks.

### 2. Monday Senior Engineer Week Kickoff — Continuity Mode
- Connects new weekly goals to last week’s outcomes, misses, and carryovers.
- Forces crisp definitions of success, quality bars, and the first Monday actions.
- Coach output provides guardrails, a time-boxed schedule, and a stakeholder-ready kickoff note to launch the week with clarity.

### 3. Weekly Senior Engineer Review — Continuity Mode
- Friday reflection that audits outcomes, product impact, quality moves, decisions, and communication with evidence.
- Highlights where commitments slipped, which habits are compounding, and which risks must be burned down next week.
- Coach delivers a verdict against the Senior bar, concrete fixes for gaps, a craft drill, and a carryover watchlist to prevent drift.

## How to Use

1. Paste the prompts into your coaching workflow (journal, notes app, ChatGPT/Claude, etc.).
2. Run the **Daily** prompt every weekday morning and respond honestly; let the coach push back.
3. On **Monday**, use the kickoff to anchor the week in continuity and guardrails.
4. On **Friday**, run the weekly review to synthesize proof of impact and lock in next week’s focus.

## Why This Works

The prompts create a feedback loop that:
- Links every plan back to recent execution, preventing comfort-zone repetition.
- Makes quality, risk management, and visibility part of “done,” not afterthoughts.
- Builds the instincts of a durable Senior+ engineer — one measured by outcomes, leverage, and craftsmanship.
