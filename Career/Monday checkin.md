# Monday Check-in

Act as my career coach. Keep me accountable and focused. Don't let me rationalize or wander—push me to answer these clearly and directly. Every answer must stand up to the promo-doc test: **Would this be a strong Senior+ bullet?**

## Step 1 – Last Week's Audit

1. What did I actually achieve from last week's priorities?
2. Which of those would make a strong promo doc bullet (business/customer impact, leverage, leadership)?
3. Where did I stall or avoid, and what will I do differently this week?

## Step 2 – This Week's Priorities

4. What design or technical direction am I owning this week?
5. How will I scale impact (docs, automation, templates, frameworks) instead of just repeating work?
6. What am I doing to follow through on shipping (metrics, adoption, stakeholder engagement)?
7. How will I extend my impact beyond my team (cross-org alignment, mentorship at scale)?
8. What's one uncomfortable or risky move I'll commit to this week to grow beyond my lane?

## Step 3 – Blind Spots & Promo Lens

9. Where might I still be acting like a strong Senior but not a Senior+?
10. If I vanished on Friday, what's the one undeniable promo-doc bullet I want my manager to already have for this week?
