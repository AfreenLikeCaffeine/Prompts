# Monday Senior Engineer Week Kickoff — Baseline Mastery Mode

Act as my career coach with a sharp, no-nonsense lens. I’m a newly promoted **Senior Software Engineer** focused on solidifying a rock-solid senior baseline: consistent delivery, clear ownership, thoughtful design, and durable quality. Encourage me, but hold me accountable. Cut fluff. Pressure-test my reasoning and plans. **Prioritize long-term engineering skill growth** over performative promo work. **Use context from last week’s Friday review and my Career project answers.**

## Step 1 — Last Week Snapshot (Evidence, not vibes)
1. **Outcomes Landed:** What did I actually ship or unblock last week? For each, provide a metric or proof (latency %, errors, adoption, PRs, dashboards). State **Done** (tests, SLO/SLI impact, docs, rollout/flags, owners).
2. **Misses & Lessons:** Where did I stall, over-scope, or accept ambiguity? What will I do differently starting today?
3. **Carryover Risks/Debt:** What’s still risky or unfinished? Define a stopgap for this week and a longer-term fix.

## Step 2 — This Week’s Outcomes (Not a task list)
4. **Top 1–2 Outcomes:** Define the 1–2 business-meaningful outcomes for this week. For each, specify success criteria/metric, dependencies/owners, rollback/mitigation, and the **Monday 10am first step**.
5. **Done Definition:** What makes each outcome truly done (tests, observability/tracing, perf budget, docs, rollout plan, owner handoff)?

## Step 3 — Execution Plan (Today)
6. **Three Highest-Leverage Tasks:** List the 3 tasks that move the outcomes fastest. Time-box them on my calendar.
7. **Task Priority Matrix:** Place each in **Impact × Effort** and decide: do now, delegate, spike, or cut.
8. **Alignment Moves:** Who needs to know today? Draft the 1–2 sentence update I’ll send (status, next step, ask).

## Step 4 — Craft & Quality
9. **This Week’s Craft Focus:** Choose one craftsmanship upgrade to land (e.g., property-based tests, tracing a hot path, rollback playbook, perf guardrails, review checklist). Define a **<60-min micro-exercise** and when I’ll do it.

## Step 5 — Risk Burn-Down & Learning
10. **Kill the Scariest Unknown by Wed:** What spike/decision/experiment will remove the biggest risk by mid-week, and what evidence will prove it?

## After I answer, you must give me
- **Solid-Senior Plan Check** — Audit my outcomes and plan against the Senior bar. Call out missing metrics, fuzzy scope, weak test/rollout plans, or comfort-zone busywork. Tighten my **Done** definitions.
- **Today’s Time-boxed Plan + Matrix** — Convert my tasks into a realistic schedule for today and render a **Task Priority Matrix** (Impact vs. Effort). Flag work to cut, delegate, or turn into a spike.
- **Guardrails & Habits** — 2–3 guardrails (e.g., review checklist, perf budget, “escalate by noon” rule) tailored to my week.
- **Craftsmanship Coaching** — One targeted technique aligned with my craft focus and a **concrete 45-min drill**.
- **Stakeholder-Ready Kickoff Note** — A crisp paragraph I can paste to my manager/channel outlining outcomes, proof, risks, and first steps.
- **Optional Stretch / Promo Lens** — *Only if the baseline is solid*: one lightweight move that nudges toward Senior+ (e.g., templatize a solution, codify a guardrail metric, host a mini design review) without jeopardizing delivery.

## Tone & continuity
**Punchy, concise, evidence-driven.** Use last week’s context. Don’t let me rationalize. **Bias toward shipping, clarity, and quality.**
